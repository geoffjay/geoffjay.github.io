## Using three.js in Yew

Every so often I get the idea that I want to render something in a 2D or 3D
grid, a simulation, a set of elements, etc. As a base to support that I thought
it would be interesting to try doing that using three.js.

### Setup

As is always the case, there are multiple ways to pull a JS package into a Yew
application. This one assumes that `trunk` is being used.

To the `index.html` file which is likely at the root of the project add:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "three": "https://unpkg.com/three@0.159.0/build/three.module.js",
      "three/addons/": "https://unpkg.com/three@0.159.0/examples/jsm/"
    }
  }
</script>
```

### Adding a Scene

Create a Javascript file somewhere, eg. `js/scenes/three.js` and add:

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const window_ratio = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window_ratio, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

export function init() {
  const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");

  renderer.setSize(800, 600);
  canvas.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

  scene.add(cube);

  camera.position.z = 5;

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

export function render() {
  requestAnimationFrame(render);

	cube.rotation.x += 0.0001;
	cube.rotation.y += 0.0001;

	renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

These will be used by the Yew component that's going to render our scene. To
execute the setup and render functions some bindings need to be added, for that
create a module in a file named `bindings.rs` and add:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(module = "/js/scenes/three.js")]
extern "C" {
    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn init();

    #[wasm_bindgen]
    pub fn render();
}
```

Finally, the scene can be rendered from a component. This is an example that
makes a few assumptions about how the project is setup:

- `yew` version 0.21 is being used
- `yew-hooks` has been included as a dependency
- `tailwind` is used for styling

Place the following in a component that's loaded by your application.

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;
use yew_hooks::use_raf;

use crate::bindings::{init, render};

#[function_component(Scene)]
pub fn scene() -> Html {
    let initialized = use_state_eq(|| false);
    let elapsed = use_raf(5000, 100);
    let then = use_state(|| Date::now());
    let fps = use_state(|| 1000.0 / elapsed);

    let handle_init = use_callback(
        initialized.setter(),
        |_input, initialized_setter| {
            init();
            initialized_setter.set(true);
        },
    );

    use_effect_with(
        elapsed,
        move |_| {
            if *initialized {
                let fps_interval = 1000.0 / 60.0;
                let now = Date::now();
                let dt = now - *then;

                if dt as f64 > fps_interval {
                    render();
                    then.set(now);
                    fps.set(1000.0 / dt);
                }
            }
        },
    );

    html! {
        <div class="container">
            <div class="text-xl">{"Portfolio"}</div>
            <button onclick={handle_init}>{"init"}</button>
            <div id="canvas" class="w-[800px] h-[600px]"></div>
        </div>
    }
}
```

As a first step I decided to make it so that a button needed to be pressed to
start the scene and begin rendering. Obviously, this could be changed to start
on load, but I was having issues with the DOM taking longer to load that the
functions that were trying to use the element and I'm leaving that for a later
attempt. It also may not be necessary, but in an attempt to restrict the frame
rate I'm checking that the time elapsed exceeds the frame rate interval. This
could be handled better, but for the purposes of this post it's sufficient.
