## Building an Elixir Application

Build an application using Elixir and Phoenix...

For now this is just notes, there's a [repo](https://github.com/halfbakedio/nnn) but it's still
early on.

Currently hosted at https://nnn.fly.dev/.

### Ideas

- white-labeled for custom domain and branding
- multi-tenancy where each account has its own database
- custom feature flag service implemented as an app using distributed tasks (see references)
- supports social login
- GraphQL API
- Triplex for account tenancy
